 * @list: the list to check
 *
 * Description: uses Floydâ€™s Cycle-Finding Algorithm
 * -------------------------------
 * A hash table can also be used:
 * Traverse the given linked list and put the address of each node in a Hash table.
 * If you reach a node whose next pointer is NULL, then given linked list doesn't
 * contain s cycle.
 * If address of any node already exist in Hash table, it means we are visiting this node
 * again and linked list contains a cycle.
 *
 * Return: 0 if no cycle; 1 if  cycle exists
